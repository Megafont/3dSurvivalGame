**NOTES:**
I created the TreeLeavesShaderGraph by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBADOmohQ8M).

It should also be noted that the trees move in the wind now, but they do not have LODs for now.
The shader does not support them. I think it needs to use the TextureSampleLOD node instead.
I can look into this later if it becomes an issue.
